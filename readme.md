# Welcome to Space Camp!

Today's session will be all about the API-First Mindset, and we have several sessions to go through today.

## This Content

The purpose of the content you're reading right now is so that you have some material to take away with you, in digital form, and for accessibility for those who want more time to go through the material in written form.

## Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct](https://www.postman.com/legal/events-code-of-conduct/) will be strictly enforced throughout the day. Please alert a Postman employee if you experience or witness a violation of our Code of Conduct.

## Sessions

### Foundational building blocks of API-first

In this session, we will help everyone understand what we mean by "API First", and common terminology you'll hear throughout the day. This session will be more lecture-style.

### Next-level Concepts With API-first

The second session of the day will go hands-on with developing an API using the OpenAPI specification and teaching the principles of API-First in a manner that you can follow along.

### Advanced API Workflows (2 parts)

The afternoon will be broken into two parts where we will take what you've learned in the morning sessions, and apply them.

Each afternoon session is 75 minutes in length, and will be hands-on practice and Q&A for your API-First design, and looking at concepts such as mock servers, advanced testing workflows, monitoring and deployment.

[OpenAPI Specification](./books-api.yaml)

## Follow-Along Format

This content will contain some written notes, links to slides, and links to documentation for the all-day sessions.

Since the afternoon will begin with everyone designing the same API, we will share an OpenAPI Specification file that will be used for the entire afternoon session.

## Need Help Throughout the Day?

We have two ways to get you help.

We have a team of Postman employees, who we call "Postmanauts", who are available to help you. Raise your hand, or approach an employee if you're comfortable doing so. We will be careful about social distancing.

Secondly, we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WBUnS4SUjz) set up specifically for today. If you need help you can drop your question into the appropriate channel there. If you find yourself with some spare time throughout the day, you're welcome to assist other attendees in the Discord community as well.

### Getting help beyond today

After today's session, the Discord server may not be updated. We invite you to ask questions in our [community forum](https://community.postman.com/).
