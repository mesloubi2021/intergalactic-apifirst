# Welcome to Space Camp!

Today's session will be all about the API-First Mindset, and we have several sessions to go through today.

## Sessions

### Foundational building blocks of API-first

In this session, we will help everyone understand what we mean by "API First", and common terminology you'll hear throughout the day. This session will be more lecture-style.

### Next-level Concepts With API-first

The second session of the day will go hands-on with developing an API using the OpenAPI specification and teaching the principles of API-First in a manner that you can follow along.

### Advanced API Workflows (2 parts)

The afternoon will be broken into two parts where we will take what you've learned in the morning sessions, and apply them.

Each afternoon session is 75 minutes in length, and will be hands-on practice and Q&A for your API-First design, and looking at concepts such as mock servers, advanced testing workflows, monitoring and deployment.

- [OpenAPI Specification for the Afternoon](./books-api-afternoon.yaml)

## Follow-Along Format

This content will contain some written notes, links to slides, and links to documentation for the all-day sessions.

Since the afternoon will begin with everyone designing the same API, we will share an OpenAPI Specification file that will be used for the entire afternoon session.
